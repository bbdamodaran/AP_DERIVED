Urban Land Cover Classification](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/publis/pers2017.pdf)", Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, Vol. 83, No. 3, March 2017

This repository contains R codes for several machine learning algorithms: SVM, PerTurbo, Naive Bayes, Multinomial logistic regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. It also includes functions to read and write the remote sensing images in the Envi format (Binary Files)

For running the codes, please see: "Mainfile.R", and if you want run the codes in cluster, please see: "MainFile_DTRFNBMLRCluster.R"
